# Changelog

All notable changes will be documented in this file.

## 1.2.0 - 2021-11-07

### New Features

-   Sanitization of the toast title and message is now optional, and enabled by default.

```php
toast()
    ->danger('I will goâ€¦<br><i>to the next line ðŸ’ª</i>', 'I am <span style="color:red;">HOT</span>')
    ->doNotSanitize()
    ->push();
```

IF you have previously published the vendor views, you should re-publish them, or just change `x-text` to `x-html`
inside `includes\content.blade.php`

See the documentation's [Text Sanitization](https://github.com/usernotnull/tall-toasts#text-sanitization), and review

[security best practices](https://github.com/usernotnull/tall-toasts#security-vulnerabilities).
