- Support for Laravel 10
- Minor fix for dark styled toast on mouse hover

## v1.5.1 - Aug 11, 2022

Minor UI tweak to force toasts above tailwind's z-50 (toasts should always be above any UI as they offer temporary yet usually crucial information to the user that should not be hidden by other elements)

```js
// JS
Toast.debug('I will NOT show in production! Locally, I will also log in console...', 'A Debug Message');
```

```php
// PHP
toast()
    ->debug('I will NOT show in production! Locally, I will also log in console...', 'A Debug Message')
    ->push();

// debug also accepts objects as message
toast()
    ->debug(User::factory()->createOne()->only(['name', 'email']), 'A User Dump')
    ->push();
```

## 1.2.1 - 2021-11-19

-   **[FIX]** Avoid showing 'undefined' as toast title/message in rare situations.

## 1.2.0 - 2021-11-09

-   **[FEATURE]** Sanitization of the toast title and message is now optional, and enabled by default.

```php
// PHP
toast()
    ->danger('I will goâ€¦<br><i>to the next line ðŸ’ª</i>', 'I am <span style="color:red;">HOT</span>')
    ->doNotSanitize()
    ->push();
```

IF you have previously published the vendor views, you should re-publish them, or just change `x-text` to `x-html`
inside `includes\content.blade.php`

See the documentation's [Text Sanitization](https://github.com/usernotnull/tall-toasts#text-sanitization), and review
the
[security best practices](https://github.com/usernotnull/tall-toasts#security-vulnerabilities).
